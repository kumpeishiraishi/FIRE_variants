* Some variants of the FIRE algorithm
The Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine (FIRE) algorithm is a popular choice for energy minimization in the field of atomistic simulations.
It was first proposed in 2006, and several improvements and variants have been proposed recently.
This repository contains my implementations of these FIRE algorithms for the system of binary Lennard-Jones particles.
